# Key words
* Human-Robot teaming
* Temporal plannng networks (TPN)

# Abstract
* Robots need to deal with uncertainty due to 1) working with humans who are unpredictable; 2) operate in a dynamic environment.
* Ingoring all uncertainties is dangerous, while accounting for all possible outcomes is often computationally infeasible.
* Temporal planning network (TPN) is a middle-ground approach between two aforementioned options. 

# Introduction
* TPNs were originally designed to control robotic space explorers. 
* TPNs is complex in construction. TPNs need manually encoding with the help of a domain expert. 

# Background
* Temploral planning
