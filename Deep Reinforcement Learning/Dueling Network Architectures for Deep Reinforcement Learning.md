## Abstract
* This paper presents a new neural network architecture (i.e., dueling network) for model-free reinforcement learning.
* The dueling network has to streams to separately estimate (scalar) state-value and the advantages of each action. 
* Motivation: for many states, it is unnecessary to estimate the value of each action choice.
