## Introduction
* Simultion-based training provides data at low-cost, but involves inherent mismatches with real-world settings.

* Bridging the gap between simultion and reality requires:
  * methods that are able to account for mismatches in both sensing and actuation.
  * Sensing: adversarial attacks on computer vision algorithms;
  * Actuation risk: can be minimized through more realistic simltion. 
  * Other methods: introduce perturbances in the environment; focus on domain randomization; meta learning; continual learning.

* Mitigate the sim-to-real via transfer leanring and domain adaptation; knowledge distillation; meta reinforcement learning.
