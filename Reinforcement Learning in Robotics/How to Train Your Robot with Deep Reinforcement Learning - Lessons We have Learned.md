## Abstract
* This paper presents several case studies involving robotic deep reinforcement learning. 
* Based on case studies, this paper discusses commonly perceived challenges in deep RL. 
* Provide a survey for how to apply machine learning technologies in the real-world.

## Case Studies in Robotics Deep RL
* Guided Policy Search
  * The basic principle is that the neural network policy is "guided" by another RL method, typically a model-based RL algorithm.
